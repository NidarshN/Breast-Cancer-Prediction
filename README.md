# Breast Cancer Prediction App

This project is a Streamlit application that leverages a machine learning model to predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on measurements from a cytology lab. Users can input these measurements automatically or manually adjust them using intuitive sliders in the sidebar, enabling real-time updates to the prediction.
